Did her husband Alexander (Heikko Deutschmann) really have to break up with her that evening? Yes, he had to. Not only did he have different ideas about the evening but also about his whole life: he wants to be happier, he wants to be free, he does not want Marie Therese in his life anymore. As a result of this unpleasant turn of events, Marie Theres does what any sensible woman in her position would do: she goes for a drink, stumbles into Bigi's (Barbara Spitz) queer bar and meets Fa (Proschat Madani). Fa is fun-loving, spontaneous and unattached. She is open about her love life. Even though the very inhibited doctor isn't Fa's type, she still takes Marie Theres home after a boozy evening. Marie Theres however is too drunk to remember what they did or did not do. As their worlds collide, feelings emerge but nothing is simple. There is no straight path for Marie Theres and Fa!",110,What a Feeling
