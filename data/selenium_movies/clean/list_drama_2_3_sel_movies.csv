JESUS: a Deaf Missions film will take you on a journey with Jesus and his disciples. Witness His miracles, His transformative power, and His challenges to the religious elite in a time of high tension under Roman rule in Judea. The Jews were anticipating a Messiah, but Jesus was not what they expected. What the religious leaders orchestrated to be Jesus' end instead changed the world forever. Immerse yourself in Jesus' love as He offers hope, forgiveness, and eternal life. Don't miss this historic film--produced by Deaf for Deaf--with a cast fluent in American Sign Language. Deaf producer / director Joseph D. Josselyn (of Deaf Missions) and Deaf producer Michael Davis (of GUM Vision Studio) bring the movie to life for Deaf audiences.
