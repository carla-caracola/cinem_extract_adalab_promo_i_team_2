A moving chronicle of forgiveness, family, and the transformative power of art, SONGS FROM THE HOLE weaves music and storytelling into an innovative documentary visual album. Through clear-eyed narration and lyrical journal entries, incarcerated musician James ""JJ'88"" Jacobs reveals his innermost struggles as a person who has both committed and experienced violent harm. While serving a double-life prison sentence, he searches for healing and peace as he comes of age in this documentary-musical odyssey composed behind bars. In a unique creative process director Contessa Gayles (The Feminist on Cellblock Y, Founder Girls) collaborated with protagonist/writer JJ'88 and producer/music producer richie reseda to interweave the collective storytelling of the film's non-fiction participants, with imagined memories, dreams and spiritual dialogues set to JJ'88's original music. The result is a powerful mix of truth-telling and dreaming that reveal the potential for healing and liberation within us all.",106,Songs from the Hole
