Friendly with his fellow drag queens and supported by his sister, who delights in designing increasingly elaborate and beautiful costumes for his act, Simon vibrates with the passion of his adopted artistic community. When he meets Oliver (Félix Maritaud), the alluring new recruit at the club, their irresistible chemistry sparks an electric romance and a fulfilling creative collaboration. Their dynamic is mesmerizing and tender until Oliver's dominant instincts and destructive behavior jeopardize Simon's space in the spotlight. Simon has plenty of experience with tempestuous personalities -- his mother, a bona fide opera diva, is back in his life after years on the road -- but can he get out from under the shadow of their influence? Beautifully charting the highs and lows of falling in love and finding oneself in one's art, writer and director Sophie Dupuis's SOLO is a passionate feat of character-driven storytelling and visual extravagance, celebrating the drag world in all its splendor and heartache.",none,Solo
